The mono-X + $E_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}$ signal is a popular signal in the search for new physics\fg{, particularly for dark matter, which is generally expected to be invisible to a detector, and so `appears' as missing transverse momentum when balanced against a visible object that is radiated from the initial or intermediate state}. \st{It is predicted by an assorted collection of new physics models, including unparticle physics models }\cite{CMS-PAS-EXO-12-048}\st{ and the Arkani-Hamed, Dimopoulos, and Dvali (ADD) model of large extra spatial dimensions }\cite{ATLAS-CONF-2012-147}. For the $s$-channel simplified models discussed in Section \ref{sec:sec2} the SM particle, X, originates from one of a pair of intial-state \st{quarks} \fg{partons} (shown in Figure \ref{Signal_phen_a} and \ref{Signal_phen_b}). The case where X is radiated from the mediator - a process known as virtual internal Bremsstrahlung - is only possible if the SM-dark matter interaction occurs via the $t$-channel (as shown in Figure \ref{Signal_phen_c}). \st{In both cases, the parton, W and Z bosons are the SM particles most likely to be emitted }\cite{Kumar:2013iva}\st{. Hence, this paper will focus on three detection channels: monojet, mono-Z and mono-W.} \fg{In all the $s$- and $t$-channel models we consider, radiation of a parton is the most likely scenario, due to the strength of the strong coupling, and so the mono-jet channel is expected to provide the strongest limits. However, emission of $Z$ and $W$ bosons \comm{(and photon?)} is also possible, often providing a cleaner signal, and so we also include results from the mono-$Z$ and mono-$W$ processes\footnote{\fg{It is worth noting here that the mono-$W$ channel has previously been chosen for its apparent ability to distinguish a case where $u$- and $d$-type quarks couple with opposite sign to the new physics sector \cite{}\comm{(Tait)}. However, during the preparation of this paper this has been shown to be an unphysical scenario \cite{}\comm{(Bell, Leane)}.}}, which may then enhance the limit in combination with the mono-jet.}

\hspace{1cm}\draft{The monojet contraints are derived from a genertic search for new phenomena conducted by the ATLAS Collaboration using $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=$ 8 TeV (see Section \ref{monojet_constraints})}. Similarly, the mono-Z constraints are derived from a dark matter search originally optimised for the D1, D5 and D9 effective operators (see Section \ref{monoZ_constraints}). \textcolor{magenta}{Lastly, the mono-W constraints are derived from...} \comm{We should put references to all the papers here!

\bigskip

\textcolor{magenta}{Do we need something here like "The model-independent results for each of the above analyses are reintepreted as simplified model constraints following a simple methodology. Firstly..."? Or is it ok to assume that the reader understands the process employed in converting model-independent limits into limits on a specific model? Do we need to introduce them to $\sigma = N/\mathcal{L}\times\epsilon\times\mathcal{A}$?}

\comm{Hmm. I think that since the results we're using are all given in different ways (ie a limit on $\sigma^{\mathrm{vis}}$ for some, or a limit on $N_{NP}$, or even just the number of observed and predicted events (damn monoZ)), this would be better included in each channel-specific section instead. It may not be necessary to even include it though, I think it's reasonable to say 'we converted the limits to our own model' or whatever. - Amelia}

\subsection{Signal Generation}
\label{signal_generation}
\begin{flushleft}
For each channel, signal production was modelled with \MG5$\_$aMC 2.2.2 \comm{(references needed throughout this section!)}. Showering and hadronisation was then performed by \PYTHIA  8.201 using the \textcolor{magenta}{ATLAS UE Tune AU2-MSTW2008LO}. Using the MSTW2008lo68 PDF set (currently the benchmark for ATLAS analyses \cite{}. \question{Is this still true?}) and the default \MG factorization and renormalization scales\footnote{In \FNMG5 2.2.2 the default scale, $\mu$ is defined as the sum of $\sqrt{m_{\chi}^{2} + p_{T}^{2}}$ for all dark matter particles in the final state.}, samples were produced for a representative set of of dark matter and mediator masses, shown in Table \ref{Mass_coup_points}. \textcolor{magenta}{Something about the coupling strength, $f$, being set to a value of 1? Maybe leave out - we'll vary the value.} Note that rows one to three of Table \ref{Mass_coup_points} cover the case where the dark matter mass is small and the mediator has either a mass that is degenerate, low or sufficiently large so as to be in the EFT regime of validity\footnote{A recent study by Alves et al. found that EFT results do not apply to mediators with a mass less than 2.5 TeV at the LHC during Run I \cite{Alves:2011wf}.}. Rows four and five cover the case where the dark matter particle has a medium mass and the mediator is either near-degenerate or larger. Rows six and seven (eight and nine) cover the case where the dark matter particle is a few GeV (TeV) and the mediator is either near-degenerate or again sufficiently large so as to be in the EFT regime of validity. \comm{Comment on the masspoints being dictated by the narrow width approximation used by MG?}

\subsection{Monojet Constraints}
\label{monojet_constraints}
\subsubsection{Event Selection}
\begin{flushleft}
For the monojet channel, signal selection is carried out as in Ref. \cite{Aad:2015zva}: initially, events are required to have $E_{T}^{miss}>$ 150 GeV and at least one jet with $p_{T} >$ 30 GeV and $|\eta| <$ 4.5. The background contribution from QCD jets is managed with the requirement that all jets passing this initial selection criteria also satsify $|\Delta\phi(jet,{E}_{T}^{miss})|>1.0$. In order to isolate monojet-like topologies, surviving events are then required to have a leading jet, $j_{1}$, with $p_{T} >$ 120 GeV and $|\eta| <$ 2.0 satisfying $p_{T}^{j_{1}}/E_{T}^{miss} >$ 0.5. Lastly, nine separate signal regions are defined with increasing lower thresholds on $E_{T}^{miss}$ from 150 GeV to 700 GeV as shown in Table \ref{monojet_SRs}.

\begin{table}[!htbp]

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}

 Signal Region & $E_{T}^{miss}$ threshold [GeV] & $N_{obs}$ & $N_{exp}$ \\%& $N_{obs}/\mathcal{L}$ & $N_{exp}/\mathcal{L}$ \\

\subsubsection{Signal Simulation}
\begin{flushleft}
Monojet signal samples for each of the simplified models discussed in Section \ref{sec:sec2} and for each of the masspoints listed in Table \ref{Mass_coup_points} were generated following a similar procedure to that employed in the ATLAS analysis. Firstly, leading order matrix elements for the processes $pp \rightarrow j\chi\bar{\chi}$ and $pp \rightarrow jj\chi\bar{\chi}$ (where $j$ is a final state jet\footnote{In this analysis a jet is seeded by any parton excluding the (anti-)top quark.}) were generated using \MG$\_$aMC$@$NLO v2.2.2 with the default PDF (MSTW2008lo68). The default renormalisation and factorisation scales, $\mu_{R,F}$, which correspond to \comm{the geometric average of $m_{\chi}^{2} + p_{T, \chi}^{2}$}, were also used. Next, showering and hadronisation of the matrix elements was done using \PYTHIA \comm{8.185} with the default tune (ATLAS UE AU2-MSTW2008LO). Matching between \MG$\mbox{ }$and \PYTHIA was performed using the MLM scheme with matching scales of 80 GeV and 300 GeV. Samples made with the latter matching scale are included both to increase statistics in the high $E_{T}^{miss}$ region and to account for the shape bias introduced by the 80 GeV matching scale. To avoid double-counting, events from the 80 (300) GeV samples are required to have a leading jet with $p_{T} <$ ($\geq$) 350 GeV.
\bigskip

The event selection and Monte Carlo (MC) generation procedures discussed above were validated via reproduction of the ATLAS limits on the suppression scale, M$_{*}$, for the s-channel vector simplified model (refered to as the Z' model in the ATLAS monojet analysis). The results of this process are contained in appendix \ref{monojet_validation}.
\bigskip

%\draft{While the signal samples used by the ATLAS group (and for validation) correspond to the processes $pp \rightarrow j\chi\bar{\chi}$ and $pp \rightarrow jj\chi\bar{\chi}$ where $j$ is a final state jet, monojet constraints on the simplified models studied in this paper were set using signal samples with zero, one and two jets in the final state.} \comm{This deviation from the ATLAS analysis is motivated by the observation that the limits on $M_{*}$ are improved with the addition of the process $pp \rightarrow \chi\bar{\chi}$.}
%However, while the ATLAS MC samples are generated for only two matching scale values (80 GeV and 300 GeV), we use a sliding value of $m_{\chi}/4$. \comm{This ensures that all jet-related kinematic distributions are smoothly connected across all dark matter masspoints.}

THIS IS WHERE I'M UP TO!
