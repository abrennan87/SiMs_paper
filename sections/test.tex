The first simplified model considered here comprises a Dirac fermion DM particle (labeled $\chi$), coupled to SM quarks via an $s$-channel vector mediator (labeled $\xi$). The couplings of the mediator to the quark pair and DM pair are denoted $g_q$ and $g_{\chi}$ respectively, and are assumed to be equal, that is, $g_q = g_{\chi}$. The width of the vector mediator is variable by hand, and in the following study three indicative widths will be used.
