\subsection{Comparison with Relic Density Constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\comm{Copied from my paper with Karl, so I'll have to rewrite - Tom.}

If dark matter was produced thermally in the early universe, there is a simple relationship between the thermally averaged dark matter self-annihilation cross section $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm ann}$, and the observed relic abundance $\Omega_{\rm DM}h^2$. For a given model, this allows us to find the coupling strength which provides the correct relic abundance as a function of $(m_\chi, M)$. 
%
This scenario is by no means a certainty; If the observed dark matter was produced through some mechanism other than thermal production, or if some new physics has an effect on the connection between the self-annihilation rate and the abundance at freezeout, this relationship breaks down. At the same time, thermal dark matter is a well-motivated scenario, and is a useful way to get a sense of the regions of parameter space within which we expect the gravitationally-observed DM to lie. 

The observed relic abundance can be approximated as
%
\begin{equation}
\Omega_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq \frac{2\times2.4\times 10^{-10}\,{\rm GeV}^{-2}}{\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm ann}}.
\label{simplerelic}
\end{equation}
%
Combined with Planck constraints of $\Omega_{\rm DM}^{\rm obs}h^2=0.1199\pm0.0027$ \cite{Ade:2013zuv}, we see that $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm ann}\simeq 4.0\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm GeV}^{-2}$ for thermal relic DM. 
%
We use a more accurate method to constrain $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm ann}$, by simultaneously solving an expression for the freezeout temperature as a function of $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm ann}$, and the relic abundance as a function of both $\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm ann}$ and the freezeout temperature. We follow the formalism and technique from Ref.~\cite{Busoni:2014gta}.

We indicate on the figures below a line where the LHC constraint on the coupling strength corresponds to the coupling strength which would give thermal relic DM. In regions \draft{above the line or possibly below} this line, the relic density will naively be too large. For DM to lie in this region, either the thermal relic scenario must break down, or the DM annihilates via additional channels not considered here.
