Simplified models have emerged as a powerful tool for the interpretation of collider, direct and indirect detection signals of dark matter (DM). Previously,  searches for DM were conducted within the context of both Effective Field Theories (EFTs) \cite{Aad:1363019, ATLAS-CONF-2012-147, CMS-PAS-EXO-12-048, Buckley:2013jwa, Abdallah:1472683, MonoZ, MonoX} and full UV-complete theories like Supersymmetry \cite{ComppMSSM, Aad:2012ms, Aad:2012fqa, Aad:2014wea, SUSY_official_paper} and extra dimensions \cite{}. The latter approach, though well-motivated, is typified by a broad parameter space and generally yields results which are insensitive to the wider class of DM models. EFT constraints, in comparison, are applicable to a broad range of models and rely on the specification of only a small set of parameters, namely the suppression scale, $\Mstar$ and the DM mass, $\mDM$ \cite{}.
%This prescription however is known to be problematic in high-energy scenarios \cite{}, where the underlying simplification becomes invalid.

In the EFT framework, interactions between the dark and Standard Model (SM) sector are parametrised by a set of higher-dimensional effective operators \cite{}. These operators arise when the mass of the mediating particle is assumed to be significantly larger than the momentum transferred in a given interaction \cite{}. Where this is not the case, the EFT prescription can produce constraints which detour dramatically from those of the associated UV-complete model \cite{Bai:2010hh, DMCons2, Fox:2011fx, Graesser:2011vj, An:2011ck}. This is not so important in direct detection experiments where the momentum transferred in the scattering of DM particles with heavy nuclei is generally of the order of tens of keV \cite{EFTDM, DMCons3}. Similarly, in indirect searches the annihilations of non-relativistic DM particles in the galactic halo occur with momentum transfers on the order of $\mDM$ \cite{}. However, for collider searches, where the accessible center of mass energy of two colliding baryons may be sufficient to produce the mediator on-shell, the range of validity of the EFT approach is significantly diminished \cite{}. Indeed, recent works (\cite{}) have shown the EFT approach to be unreliable in some cases for the $\sqrt{\hat{s}} =$ 8 TeV Run I of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Furthermore, the problem is expected to worsen in the current 13/14 TeV Run II. So, to accurately probe this regime, we move to Simplified Models \cite{Buchmueller:2014yoa}.

In a nutshell, a simplified model arises when the heavy mediator which was integrated out in the EFT framework is reintroduced. Like EFTs, simplified models admit the comparison of results obtained in the different avenues of dark matter study \cite{} and are defined by a relatively small set of parameters - namely $m_{DM}$, the mass of the mediator, $Mmed$, and the SM-mediator and DM-mediator coupling strengths, $g_{q}$ and $g_\chi$. Unlike EFTs, constraints calculated within the context of a simplified model are valid across a broad energy range ($\mathcal{O}$(GeV-TeV)).
%, removing the question of validity of the EFT approximation \cite{}.

To date, very few analyses include a dedicated study of any simplified models of DM. This is generally because the focus in DM collider searches at both ATLAS and CMS has been on generic EFT models. The recent release of several reports and recommendations on simplified models for the LHC $[$DM forum report, other SiMs paper$]$ indicate that they are expected to play a more prominent role in Run II. The aim of this work, then, is to investigate a phenomenologically distinct set of simplified models likely to be included in Run II searches, and to constrain these using results already publicly available. In particular, constraints are placed on the simplified models corresponding to the simplest UV-completions in the $s$-channel of the D5 (vector) and D8 (axial-vector) effective operators\footnote{The D5 and D8 operators form a nice starting point in the analysis of simplified models as they have been studied exhaustively in the past (see Ref. \cite{}). This attention is motivated by the fact that collider limits for the D5 (D8) operator can be readily transformed into limits on spin-independent (spin-dependent) DM-nucleon scattering and vice versa. With the exception of D1 (see sec. \ref{section}), and D9 and D11 (which have no simple simplified model counterparts \cite{}), the remaining effective operators induce elastic scattering which is suppressed by powers of the DM velocity or the momentum transferred \cite{Kumar}. Hence, these operators are largely ignored in the literature.}. We also include a case with mediator exchange in the $t$-channel, which approaches the vector EFT model in the heavy-mediator limit, but remains kinematically distinct from its $s$-channel counterpart.

We constrain these models using public results from mono-X + missing transverse energy ($\met$) searches conducted by the ATLAS Collaboration. In particular, we focus on searches where X is either a parton (appearing as a narrow-radius jet), a leptonically-decaying $Z$ boson, or a hadronically-decaying $W$ or $Z$ boson (appearing as a large-radius jet). The purpose of this approach is both to enhance and update existing simplified model limits \cite{}, using the full 20.3 $fb^{-1}$ of Run I ATLAS data, and extend the range of phase space considered both in mass and relative strength of the couplings to the SM and DM sectors. We also aim to provide a cross-check and comparison of the performance of the three channels; while the mono-jet channel is expected to be most sensitive, the inclusion of two additional channels could enhance the limits in combination. Further, we extend the study of simplified models by allowing the width of the mediator and the SM-/DM-mediator couplings to vary, which previously have often been treated as fixed quantities \cite{}. We also include a comparison of collider limits with relic density constraints and limits from direct detection experiments.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. Section \ref{sec:sec2} contains a compendium of the simplified models chosen for analysis. Section \ref{sec:sec3} outlines the technique used to convert mono-X + $\met$ limits on the visible cross-section for any new physics process into constraints on simplified models, specifically, the couplings $g_q$ and $g_{\chi}$. Lastly, the results are presented in Section \ref{sec:sec4} along with a discussion of the implications of this work. Appendices \ref{Appendix_limitsetting} and \ref{Appendix_validation} cover the details of our limit setting procedure and analyses validation.
