In this appendix we present a summary of the procedure employed to calculate the 95\% confidence level (CL) limits on the coupling parameter $\sqrtgqgX$, where this parameter can be replaced with $\gqX$ for the tS model, and $\Mstar$ in the validation of the \monojet analysis.

\subsection{Nominal Values}
For each simplified model, the nominal value for the observed limit on the cross-section for the process $pp \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \chi\bar{\chi}$ is calculated using the formula:

\begin{equation}
\label{sigma_nom}
\sigma_{obs}^{lim}(pp \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \chi\bar{\chi}) = \frac{N_{obs}}{\mathcal{L}\times\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon}
\end{equation}
where $N_{obs}$ is a calculated 95\% CL upper limit on the number of signal events in the channel and signal region of interest; it is a model-independent quantity. $\mathcal{L}$ is the integrated luminosity, $\mathcal{A}$ is the acceptance (the fraction of signal events passing the channel/SR-specific selection criteria) and $\epsilon$ is the efficiency of the ATLAS detector for selecting channel/SR-specific signal events. For all channels the total luminosity is 20.3 fb$^{-1}$ and $\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon$ is regarded as a single variable.
%\bigskip

In the following discussion, $\sqrtgqgX$ is assumed to also represent $\gqX$ from the tS model.

The nominal value for the observed limit $Y$, where $Y$ is the suppression scale $\Mstar$ in the validation of the \monojet analysis, \emph{or} the coupling values $\sqrtgqgX$ in the general case, is then calculated using

%\begin{equation}
%\label{M_*_nom}
%\Mstar_{obs}^{lim} = \Mstar^{gen}\left[\frac{\sigma_{gen}}{\sigma_{obs}^{lim}(pp \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \chi\bar{\chi})}\right]^{1/4}
%\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{nom_lim}
Y_{obs}^{lim} = Y^{gen} \left ( \frac{\sigma_{obs}^{lim}}{\sigma^{gen}} \right)^{\frac{1}{4}} \, \, .
\end{equation}

(Note: this section needs to be re-written to account for the on-shell case as well.)

The signal region in each case is chosen based on where the best `expected' limit exists, where that limit is calculated assuming that exactly the expected SM background is observed.

%where $\Mstar^{gen}$ is the \st{theoretical} \comm{input} suppression scale and $\sigma_{gen}$ is the \st{theoretical} \comm{generated} cross-section.
%\bigskip

%Similarly, the nominal value for the limit on the observed coupling constants is calculated using the equation:

%\begin{equation}
%\label{coupling_nom}
%(\sqrtgqgX)_{obs}^{lim} = (\sqrtgqgX)^{gen}\left[\frac{\sigma_{obs}^{lim}(pp \rightarrow \mathrm{X} + \chi\bar{\chi})}{\sigma_{gen}}\right]^{1/4}
%\end{equation}

%where $(\sqrtgqgX)^{gen}$ is the product of the theoretical coupling constants. Note that $(\sqrtgqgX)^{gen}$ is always equal to $1$ for the t-channel scalar mediator model.

\subsection{Uncertainty Estimation}
Our nominal limits on $\Mstar$, $\sigma(pp \rightarrow{X} + \chi\bar{\chi})$ and $\sqrtgqgX$ rely on both $\sigma_{gen}$ and $\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon$ and so are subject to systematic uncertainties which derive from our choice of MC generation procedure. For our MC samples, there are three key sources of systematic uncertainty: the factorisation and renormalisation scales, the strong coupling constant ($\alpha_{s}$) and the parton distribution function (PDF).
% TODO: (\comm{Can we order these from largest effect to smallest? Also, should we say something about the actual choice of generator here? And what about LO vs NLO?}) The uncertainty associated with these parameters is estimated as follows.
%\bigskip

%first for the theoretical cross-section, $\sigma_{gen}$ and then for the acceptance, $\mathcal{A}$, which is defined as:
%\begin{equation}
%\mathcal{A} = \frac{N_{truth}}{N_{total}}
%\end{equation}
%where $N_{truth}$ is the number of truth-level\footnote{In the vernacular, `truth-level' events/objects are independent of detector effects.} signal events passing the selection criteria of a specific channel and $N_{total}$ is the total number of truth-level signal events for that channel.

%\subsection{Theoretical cross-section, $\sigma_{gen}$}
Firstly, the factorisation and renormalisation default scales are varied simultaneously by factors of 2 (`up') and 0.5 (`down'). The systematic effects of the strong coupling constant and the PDF are difficult to separate and so are treated in tandem. We assume that the systematic uncertainty introduced by $\alpha_{s}$ at matrix-element level is negligible when compared to the PDF uncertainties, as demonstrated to be valid in Ref. \cite{CERN-THESIS-2015-038}. The variation of $\alpha_{s}$ in conjunction with a PDF is done with the use of specific tunes in \PYTHIA, which we change simultaneously with the PDF choice to estimate the uncertainty on $\Delta \sigma_{gen}$. The nominal choices of PDF and tune are varied `up' to NNPDF2.1LO PDF + Monash tune, and `down' to CTEQ6L1 PDF and ATLAS UE AU2-CTEQ6L1 tune. \comm{Millie: put discussion of matching scale systematic here.} These systematic uncertainty sources are summarised in table~\ref{tab:syst_unc}.

\label{tab:syst_unc}
\end{table}

Following eqns. \ref{sigma_nom} and \ref{nom_lim}, the relative uncertainty in the limit on $\sqrtgqgX$ (or on $\Mstar$) is given by (to be updated with on-shell case also)

\begin{equation}
\label{unc_lim}
\frac{\Delta \sqrtgqgX}{\sqrtgqgX} = \frac{1}{4} \sqrt{\left( \frac{\Delta \sigma_{gen}}{\sigma_{gen}} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta (\mathcal{A} \times \epsilon)}{\mathcal{A} \times \epsilon} \right)^2 + \left( \frac{\Delta \mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{L}} \right)^2}
\end{equation}

For $P = \sigma_{gen}, \mathcal{A} \times \epsilon$, the relative error $\Delta P / P$ is found by summing in quadrature the separate sources of uncertainty, according to

\begin{equation}
\label{unc_P}
\left ( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right )^2_{\mathrm{total}} = \left ( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right )^2_{\mathrm{scale}} + \left ( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right )^2_{\mathrm{PDF+tune}} + \left ( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right )^2_{\mathrm{matching}}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta P$ is taken as the average distance from the nominal value $P$ when the systematic source is varied up and down. The statistical uncertainty is taken into account rather conservatively by using the 95\%CL \emph{lower} limit on $\mathcal{A} \times \epsilon$ as calculated with the Wald approximation, i.e. $\mathcal{A} \times \epsilon \rightarrow (\mathcal{A} \times \epsilon) - \Delta(\mathcal{A} \times \epsilon)$. The uncertainty on the luminosity is less than 3\%, so is considered to be negligible in comparison to other systematic sources.

\fg{OLD STUFF HERE}

These systematic uncertainty sources are summarised in table~\ref{tab:syst_unc}. The uncertainty on some parameter $P$ (\comm{is `variable' a better word here?}), arising from each systematic source, is denoted $\left ( \frac{\Delta P}{P} \right)_{\mathrm{source}}$ and is obtained by varying each source up and down and calculating the average difference from the nominal value of $P$. The fractional uncertainty on $\sigma_{gen}$ is then calculated by summing in quadrature the fractional uncertainties from each systematic source.
\comm{Actually, I'm not sure about this bit - I removed the equation cos I thought it isn't really necessary (ie can be explained in a simple sentence, and we've got several similar equations coming up), but then defining $P$ etc becomes obsolete.}

%\label{tab:syst_unc}
%\end{table}

%For $\sigma_{gen}$, the uncertainty is then calculated using the formula:
%\begin{equation}
%\label{uncertainty_sigma_gen}
%\left(\frac{\Delta \sigma_{gen}}{\sigma_{gen}}\right)^{2} = \left(\frac{\Delta \sigma_{gen}}{\sigma_{gen}}\right)_{\mbox{\footnotesize scale}}^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta \sigma_{gen}}{\sigma_{gen}}\right)_{\mbox{\footnotesize PDF+tune}}^{2}
%\end{equation}

%where $\sigma_{gen}$ is the nominal theoretical cross-section, $(\Delta \sigma_{gen})_{\mbox{\footnotesize scale}}$ is the uncertainty on $\sigma_{gen}$ due to the factorisation and renormalisation scales and $(\Delta \sigma_{gen})_{\mbox{\footnotesize PDF+tune}}$ is the uncertainty on $\sigma_{gen}$ due to the PDF and strong coupling constant.
%\bigskip

%\textcolor{magenta}{Should we say something here about using only leading order predictions? For example, should we comment on the uncertainty associated with not including NLO corrections to the cross-section?} %It is important to note that a complete examination of the uncertainties associated
%with each simplified model and each mass and coupling combination was not necessary.

%\comm{Good question, can Thomas comment? Tom+Karl paper seems to suggest the impact is negligible? - Amelia}
%\bigskip

The uncertainty on $\mathcal{A} \times \epsilon$ is estimated using a similar approach but with two key differences. Firstly, the statistical uncertainty (taken to be the 95\% confidence interval on $\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon$ as calculated using the Wald approximation) is subtracted from the nominal value. Equation \ref{uncertainty_sigma_gen} is then applied to this new variable (denoted $\mathcal{A}'$). Secondly, the matching scale between \MG\mbox{ }and \PYTHIA is included when estimating the uncertainty on $\mathcal{A}'$ for the monojet channel. Following the approach utilised by the ATLAS group \cite{CERN-THESIS-2015-038}, conservative matching scale uncertainties of 10\% for events with $\met <$ 350 GeV and 60\% for events with $\met >$ 350 GeV were used for the validation (\comm{and for the results?}).

%As in the case of the factorisation and renormalisation scales, the matching scale uncertainty is determined by varying the value of the qcut up by a factor of two (to a value of $\mX/2$) and down by a factor of two (to a value of $\mX/8$). The uncertainty on $\mathcal{A}'$ is then quantified as the average change in $\mathcal{A}'$ resulting from these up and down variations.
\comm{The matching scale uncertainty is ignored at the theoretical cross-section level because...}
%\bigskip

Finally, the 95\% CL uncertainties on $\sigma_{obs}^{lim}$, $\Mstar$ and $\sqrtgqgX$ are given by the following equations:

\begin{equation}
\label{uncertainty_sigma_lim}
\frac{\Delta \sigma_{obs}^{lim}}{\sigma_{obs}^{lim}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta \mathcal{A}'}{\mathcal{A}'}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta \mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{L}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta N}{N}\right)^{2}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{uncertainty_M_star}
\frac{\Delta \mbox{M}_{*,obs}^{lim}}{\mbox{M}_{*,obs}^{lim}} = \frac{\Delta (\sqrtgqgX)_{obs}^{lim}}{(\sqrtgqgX)_{obs}^{lim}} = \left|\frac{1}{4}\right|\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta \sigma_{gen}}{\sigma_{gen}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta \sigma_{obs}^{lim}}{\sigma_{obs}^{lim}}\right)^{2}}
\end{equation}

\question{Should we have more of an explanation for why we use formulae \ref{sigma_nom} through \ref{uncertainty_M_star}?}
