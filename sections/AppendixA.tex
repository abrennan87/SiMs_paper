For each channel, the 95\% confidence level limits on the suppression scale, M$_{*}$, are calculated using the following formula:

\begin{equation}
\label{uncertainty_formula}
\frac{\Delta \mbox{M}_{*}}{\mbox{M}_{*}} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta \sigma_{gen}}{\sigma_{gen}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta \mathcal{A}}{\mathcal{A}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta \epsilon}{\epsilon}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta \mathcal{L}}{\mathcal{L}}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{\Delta N}{N}\right)^{2}}
\end{equation}

where $\sigma_{gen}$ is the theoretical cross-section, $\mathcal{A}$ is the fraction of signal events passing the channel-specific selection criteria, $\epsilon$ is the efficiency of the ATLAS detector for selecting channel-specific signal events and $\mathcal{L}$ is the integrated luminosity of data recorded by the ATLAS detector and used for the analysis. For the monojet channel, $\mathcal{L}=20.3$ fb$^{-1}$ and the uncertainty on the theoretical cross-section, $\Delta \sigma_{gen}$ and the acceptance, $\Delta \mathcal{A}$ is estimated as described in Ref. \cite{CERN-THESIS-2015-038}. \comm{Comment on the specific systematics that go into $\Delta \sigma_{gen}$ and $\Delta \mathcal{A}$?} \draft{A similar approach is used for the mono-Z channel... include reference here?}
