In this paper we have examined a set of three simplified dark matter models, extracting constraints from ATLAS Run I missing energy searches featuring the associated production of a mono-jet, $Z(\rightarrow$ leptons), or $W/Z (\rightarrow$ hadrons). We explored a phase space where both the DM and mediator masses span $\mathcal{O}$(GeV) to $\mathcal{O}$(TeV), and considered ratios of $\gX / \gq$ of 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 in the $s$-channel models. Where $\mX > \Mmed$ and perturbative unitarity isn't violated (in the $sA$ model), we applied a reweighting procedure to account for the \MG~treatment of the mediator as a Breit-Wigner propagator.  Rather than setting limits in the $\Mmed - \mDM$ plan for a fixed value of the coupling strength, we instead constrained the coupling strength as a function of both $\Mmed$ and $\mDM$ in a 3D plane. Whilst this approach necessitates the introduction of some approximations, it also allows for a thorough examination of the interplay between the DM production cross-section and the free parameters of the models.

As expected, the \monojet channel is found to yield the strongest limits on vector and axial-vector SM and DM couplings to a vector mediator exchanged in the $s$-channel. This channel is also found to perform well for small values of $\gX$. The limits obtained in the \monoZ channel, in comparison, are generally weaker by a factor of a few, while the \monoWZ results are weaker again. This is partly due to our conservative estimations of the systematic uncertainties and partly due to limited statistics resulting from a harder $\met$ selection cut. The width effects associated with the $t$-channel exchange of an SU(2) doublet scalar mediator are observed to vanish in both the \monoZ and \monoWZ channels, greatly simplifying the analysis and confirming these as straightforward and competitive channels for future collider DM detection.

Where the axial-vector model is not excluded by perturbative unitarity requirements, we find the coupling limits to be on par with those of the vector model within each analysis channel. Weaker limits are found for the $t$-channel model, a result of cross-section suppression not present in the $s$-channel models.

Finally, we compared our limits to constraints from relic density and direct detection; although each search has a different set of assumptions, this demonstrates the complementarity and impressive reach of simplified models as a tool for the interpretation of collider DM searches. We eagerly await the improved constraints expected from Run II of the LHC.

%For example, where $\mDM$ and $\Mmed$ are (near-)degenerate, \textcolor{magenta}{on-shell} and low ($\mathcal{O}$(1 - 20 GeV)), the strongest limits on $\sqrt{\gq\gX}$ are $<$0.4 (coming from the \monojet channel). Outside of this regime, the strongest valid limits range from $<$0.001 to 0.9 (again coming from the \monojet channel). For the $t$-channel model, we find that the best limits on $\gqX$ originate from the \monoZ channel and range from \textcolor{magenta}{something to something}.

%\subsection{Comparison with Relic Density Constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%%\comm{Copied from my paper with Karl, so I'll have to rewrite - Tom.}
%
%In Figs.~\ref{} we show lines where the constraint on the coupling corresponds to the coupling strength that would reproduce the correct DM density if DM is a thermal relic of the early universe. For points diagonally above and to the left of the dashed line, the LHC constraints naively rule out the couplings leading to the correct relic density. Below and to the right of this line the relic density coupling is still allowed.
%
% In this scenario, the measured abundance is approximately related to the unknown self-annihilation cross-section via
%%
%\begin{equation}
%  \Omega_{\rm DM}h^2\simeq \frac{2\times2.4\times 10^{-10}\,{\rm GeV}^{-2}}{\langle\sigma v\rangle_{\rm ann}}.
%  \label{simplerelic}
%\end{equation}
%%
%This is used with measurements of the DM abundance by Planck, $\Omega_{\rm DM}^{\rm obs}h^2=0.1199\pm0.0027$ \cite{Ade:2013zuv}, to find $\sigv_{\rm ann}\simeq 4.0\times 10^{-9}\,{\rm GeV}^{-2}$ for thermal relic DM.
%%
%This relation is only approximately accurate, and so we use the Micromegas code \cite{Belanger:2014vza} to determine the coupling strength leading to the correct relic density for each model. We verified this technique against the semi-analytic technique outlined in e.g. Ref.~\cite{Busoni:2014gta}.
%
%If the DM mass lies at the electroweak scale, the thermal relic scenario provides a natural explanation for the observed DM density, and so the coupling strengths leading to the correct relic density are a natural  benchmark with which to compare constraints from other DM searches, indicating the scale at which we expect the couplings may lie. However the relic density couplings should by no means be treated as a constraint. If the DM was not produced thermally or if there is some unknown effect which modifies the evolution of the density with temperature, then these relations break down. Further, even if DM is a thermal relic, then the relationship no longer holds if there are other annihilation channels not taken into account, or if there are other beyond-SM particles contributing to the DM abundance.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\subsection{Comparison with Direct Detection Constraints}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%In Figs.~\ref{} we also show the intercept line where constraints from  direct detection experiments are equally as strong as the LHC constraint. Below and to the right of the dotted line, direct detection constraints are stronger than the LHC constraint, while above and to the left, the LHC gives the stronger constraint. We use the toolset from Ref.~\cite{1307.5955} to convert the strongest available direct detection constraints, which are from the LUX 2013 dataset ~\cite{1309.3259}, onto constraints on our models.
%
%Compared to direct detection, the LHC performs relatively better for the SAD model than for the SVD model. This is because the axial-vector coupling leads to a suppressed scattering rate in direct detection experiments while the LHC is relatively insensitive to the difference between the vector and axial-vector couplings. In the non-relativistic limit, the TSD model leads to a mix of both suppressed and unsuppressed operators.
%
%The direct detection constraints assume that the DM candidate under consideration contributes 100\% of the local DM density, while the LHC constraints make no assumptions about either the local DM density or overall abundance. In this sense the LHC constraints remain useful even in the region where they are not as strong as those from direct detection.

%\subsection{Discussion}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
%\begin{itemize}
%
%\item Comparison to direct mediator searches: dijet gives strongest constraints on mediator especially for small r. Missing ET still good for large M but in this region EFT is fine
%
%\item Comparison to non-grid searches, e.g. McCullough et al
%
%\item Comparison to grid searches e.g. Zurek et al, Jacques and Nordstrom
