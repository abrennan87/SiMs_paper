We begin with a short set of assumptions: that the DM particle, $\chi$, is a weakly interacting Dirac fermion, that it is a singlet under the SM, and that it is the lightest stable new particle. We also require minimal flavour violation (MVF) to hold wherever relevant. (\comm{Not sure if this is relevant anymore, if we've ditched the scalar model. - Mia}) Each model is built around a scenario whereby $\chi$ and SM quarks are coupled via a mediator. Coupling to SM leptons \cite{} or gluons \cite{} is beyond the scope of this paper, but these cases have been studied elsewhere. Resolving the contact interaction of an EFT at tree-level leads to two possibilities: the mediating particle is exchanged in the $s$-channel, in which case it is also a SM singlet, or it is exchanged in the $t$-channel, in which case it is necessarily charged and coloured. With these assumptions in mind, two $s$-channel models and one $t$-channel model were chosen for analysis. 

The $s$-channel models are characterised by vector (sV) or axial-vector (sA) couplings to both the dark and SM sectors. In the notation of Ref.~\cite{DMCons2}, these correspond to the D5 and D8 operators respectively in the EFT regime. These models are described by the following interaction Lagrangians:
\begin{equation}
\label{L_int_sV}
\mathcal{L}_{sV} = - \xi_{\mu}\left[ \sum\limits_{q} g_{q}\bar{q}\gamma^{\mu}q - g_{\chi}\bar{\chi}\gamma^{\mu}\chi\right],
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{L_int_sA}
\mathcal{L}_{sA} =  \xi_{\mu}\left[\sum\limits_{q} g_{q}\bar{q}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{5}q - g_{\chi}\bar{\chi}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{5}\chi\right],
\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{L_int_sS}
%\mathcal{L}_{sS} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{6} g_{q_i}\bar{q_i}q_i\eta + g_{\chi}\bar{\chi}\chi\eta,
%\end{equation}
\st{where the sum is over all quarks, $\xi$ is the (axial-)vector mediator and $\chi$ is the dark matter particle - a weakly interacting SM singlet Dirac fermion with mass $m_{\chi}$.}
%\question{The scalar model should really have a Yukawa coupling (ie $g_q \rightarrow g_q m_q / v$) if we want to be consistent with D1 and the ATLAS/CMS run2 simplified models. Is it too late to implement this? - Tom.} \comm{I agree, and this should be easy enough to implement I think. - Amelia} 
%\st{For simplicity, it is assumed that both $\xi$ and $\eta$ are SM singlet particles and couple only to pair-antipair combinations of $\chi$ and the SM quarks, with coupling strengths $g_{\chi}$ and $g_q$ respectively.} 
For the couplings $g_q$ and $g_{\chi}$ to remain within the perturbative regime, they are required to satisy $g_{q},g_{\chi} \leq 4\pi$, though stronger perturbativity requirements do exist \cite{ValidEFT}.

%\st{Finally, for convenience, the mediator is assumed to couple to }$\cancel{\chi}$\st{ with the same strength as to each of the six quarks, that is, }$\cancel{g_{q} = g_{\chi} \equiv f}$. \comm{Removed, since we want to include cases where this isn't true! - Amelia} 
%Note that the vector and axial-vector models have already been studied extensively \cite{Buchmueller:2014yoa, Chatrchyan:2013qha, Aad:2012hf, Harris:2014hga} and so serve as a good basis for the comparison of constraints. \comm{I need to add some citations for the scalar model here - Tom}

The last model considered in this paper, a $t$-channel scalar mediator model (which we refer to by the descriptor tS), juxtaposes nicely with the $s$-channel models. In the heavy-mediator limit, it is converted into a combination of the D5 and D8 EFT operators via Fierz transformation. In addition, the tS model is motivated by analogy with a common aspect of Supersymmetric models: neutralino DM interacting with the SM sector via $t$-channel exchange of a squark\footnote{Note that in the Supersymmetric scenario the DM particle is a Majorana fermion. Simplified models in which the DM particle is a Majorana fermion are not covered here (the exception being in the validation of the mono-$Z$ channel, see sec.\ref{monoZ_validation}) as they are kinematically identical to the corresponding Dirac cases, and only require multiplication of the cross-section by a simple factor in order to calculate limits. The exception to this rule is the $s$-channel vector mediator model, which vanishes if $\chi$ is a Majorana fermion \cite{METSig}.} \cite{SUSYDM}.
%\bigskip

In this model, the mediator which we call $\phi$ necessarily has colour charge, and can couple to either the left or right-handed quarks as a SU(2) doublet or singlet respectively. Since the LHC is insensitive to the chirality of the quarks, for simplicity we assume that the mediator couples to the left-handed quarks only, that the masses and couplings of $\phi$ are equal across the three generations, and that the masses of the two components of $\phi$ are equal. The interaction Lagrangian for this model is then:
\begin{equation}
\label{L_int_tS}
\mathcal{L}_{int} = \sum_{Q} g_{q \chi} \bar{Q} P_R \phi \chi + {\rm h.c.},
\end{equation}
where the sum is over the three $Q_L$ doublets (\comm{does this make sense?}), $g_{q \chi}$ is the scalar coupling of the incoming quark, $\phi$ and $\chi$, and $P_R$ is the usual chiral projection operator. \question{Have you included the projection operator in the code? - Tom}

\subsection{Mass and Coupling Points}  % Moved from section 3
We choose to study a representative set of dark matter and mediator masses, shown in Table \ref{Mass_coup_points}. All $m_{\chi}-M_{\mathrm{med}}$ combinations are permitted in the sV and sA models; in the tS model $M_{\mathrm{med}}$ should be greater than $m_{\chi}$, to ensure stability of the DM particle. The couplings, $g_{q}$ and $g_{q\chi}$, are set to unity while the DM-mediator coupling, $g_{\chi}$, is allowed to vary from this by up to a factor of five for the $s$-channel models. In all cases, a point in phase space is disregarded if it leads to a mediator width greater than 50\% of the mediator mass, as will be further discussed below. The mediator masses were chosen to cover a broad range of parameter space and to coincide with predominantly three regimes: (near-)degenerate ($M\approx m_{\chi}$), kinematically allowed ($M \geq 2m_{\chi}$), and EFT-like ($\sqrt{\hat{s}} << M$)\footnote{A recent study by Alves et al. found that EFT results do not apply to mediators with a mass less than 2.5 TeV at the LHC during Run I \cite{Alves:2011wf}.}. We also allow for the possibility of a light mediator/heavy WIMP scenario (M $<m_{\chi}$).

\subsection{Width effects}

An important factor when considering simplified models is to ensure the mediator width is treated appropriately, as it impacts both the cross-section calculation and, in some cases, the kinematic behaviour of the model. In previous analyses (ref) it has been common to consider mediators of a fixed width such as $\Gamma = M/8 \pi$  (the minimal width possible with only a single quark helicity coupling to the mediator with $g_q$ = 1), to take advantage of the enhancement in cross section as the width becomes small and on-shell.

In this work, the mediator widths are expanded to include coupling to all kinematically accessible quarks. We assume minimal flavour violation, which implies a universal coupling to all quark flavours. Following $[$(other minimum width papers)$]$, the minimum on-shell kinetic width for each model is given by:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{gamma_sV}
\Gamma_{sV} = & \frac{g_{\chi}^2 M}{12\pi}\left(1 + \frac{2m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)\left(1 - \frac{4m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \Theta(M-2m_{\chi}) + \sum_{\substack{q}}\frac{g_q^2M}{4\pi}\left(1 + \frac{2m_{q}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)\left(1 - \frac{4m_{q}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \Theta(M-2m_q) \\
\Gamma_{sA} = & \frac{g_{\chi}^2 M}{12\pi}\left(1 - \frac{4m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \Theta(M-2m_{\chi}) + \sum_{\substack{q}}\frac{g_q^2 M}{4\pi}\left(1 - \frac{4m_{q}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{\frac{3}{2}} \Theta(M-2m_q) \\
\Gamma_{tS} = & \sum_{\substack{q}} \frac{g_{q\chi}^2M}{16\pi}\left(1 - \frac{m_{q}^{2}}{M^{2}} - \frac{m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)\sqrt{\left(1 - \frac{m_{q}^{2}}{M^{2}} + \frac{m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{2} - 4\frac{m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}} \,\, \Theta(M-m_q-m_{\chi}) \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
%\label{gamma_sA}
%\Gamma_{sA} = \frac{g_{\chi}^2 M}{12\pi}\left(1 - \frac{4m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{3/2} + \sum_{\substack{q}}\frac{g_q^2 M}{4\pi}\left(1 - \frac{4m_{q}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{3/2} 
%\end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\label{gamma_sS}
%\Gamma_{sS} = \frac{\fg{g_{\chi}^2} M}{8\pi}\left(1 - \frac{4m_{\chi}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{3/2} + \sum_{\substack{q}}\frac{3\fg{g_q^2} M}{8\pi}\left(1 - \frac{4m_{q}^{2}}{M^{2}}\right)^{3/2}
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
%\begin{aligned}
%\label{gamma_tS}
\st{where $m_{\chi} \leq M/2$ is required for the $s$-channel models and $M \geq m_{\chi} + m_{q}$ is required for the $t$-channel model. Note also that the summation over $q$ is restricted to quarks with $m_{q} \leq M/2$ for all models.} \fg{(I moved this `statement' to the $\Theta$s in the equations, since as a separate statement it sounds a bit like we don't consider points where $m_{\chi} < M$, for eg, which we do.)}

The expressions for width above are valid where that width is smaller than the mass of the mediator. Moreover, a recent paper [Tom+Karl, others?] demonstrated that the MadGraph treatment of the mediator as a Breit-Wigner propagator, rather than a true kinetic propagator, is accurate only up to $\Gamma \lesssim M/2$. We find this to hold true in all cases where the couplings are set to unity, and violated in a set of $s$-channel cases\footnote{Note that the $t$-channel widths are consistently narrower than their $s$-channel counterparts,  as there are six independent mediators (to avoid coupling quarks of different flavours) compared to the single $s$-channel model mediator.} where the coupling ratio satisfies $g_{\chi}/g_q \geq 2$. These points in phase space are therefore not included in this work. 

The impact of varying the mediator width is demonstrated in Fig~\ref{MET_SVD_monoZ}. For the sV and tS models, we plot a simplified $\met$ distribution, as a proxy for the full selection in each analysis, for two and three demonstrative mass points and couplings respectively.  The strength of the coupling directly impacts the width of the mediator in each case. In the mono-$Z$ channel, the $\met$ distribution is predominantly independent of the mediator width, and this is also true for the sV model in the mono-jet channel. However, there is a clear variation in kinematic behaviour in the tS model in the mono-jet channel, which can be attributed to additional diagrams with a gluon in the initial state, accessible in the mono-jet channel, which allow the mediator to go on-shell. In this scenario, when the resulting quark and DM particle are both small compared to the mediator mass, they share equally its energy leading to a peak in the $\met$ distribution at approximately half the mediator mass.


For the sV and sA models in both analysis channels, and the tS model in the mono-$Z$ channel, we can take advantage when calculating the limiting couplings of both the independence of the kinematic behaviour from the coupling, and the approximation that $\sigma \sim g_q^2 g_{\chi}^2$ becomes valid when $\Gamma < M/2$, following the Breit-Wigner treatment of the propagator. See App B.1 for further discussion of this calculation. For this case of tS model in the mono-jet analysis, this process is not valid as one can’t assume that scaling the coupling will lead to an unchanged kinematic behaviour. Instead, we iterate the sample generation with varying couplings and calculate the `limiting' coupling value as above, then stop once the generated coupling and `limiting' coupling converge.

%In previous analyses it has been customary to consider mediators of fixed width ranging from $\Gamma = M/8\pi$ to $\Gamma = M/3$ \cite{METSig, Fox:2012ee} \footnote{\textcolor{magenta}{Also add a reference for the recent monojet paper.}}. This approach is motivated by the observation that, where the mediator is exchanged in the $s$-channel and produced on-shell, $\sigma\left(pp \rightarrow X + \bar{\chi}\chi\right)$ is maximally enhanced when $\Gamma$ is small\footnote{For a more in depth discussion see Ref. \cite{METSig}.}. The smallest width, $\Gamma = M/8\pi$, corresponds to a mediator which couples only to one helicity and flavour of quark with $g_{q} = 1$ \cite{METSig}. In this paper, the mediator widths are expanded to include coupling to all kinematically accessible quark flavours. We also allow for flavour-blind coupling (when not restricted by MFV), so our definition of the minimum width must change to reflect this. Following $[$(other minimum width papers)$]$, the minimum width for each model is given by:

%The expressions for width above are valid where that width is smaller than the mass of the mediator; moreover, a recent paper [Tom+Karl] demonstrated that the MadGraph treatment of the particle width is accurate only up to $\Gamma < \frac{M}{2}$. We find this to hold true in all cases where the couplings are set to unity, and violated in a set of $s$-channel cases where the coupling ratio satisfies $\frac{g_{\chi}}{g_q} \geq 2$. These points in phase space are therefore not included in this work.

%\begin{equation}
%\label{Xsec_sim_coupling4}
%(g_q g_{\chi})_{\mathrm{lim}} = (g_q g_{\chi})_{\mathrm{gen}} \times \left ( \frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{lim}}}{\sigma_{\mathrm{gen}}} \right )^{\frac{1}{2}}
%\end{equation}
%where uncertainties are ignored for now. This approximation also relies on the kinematic behaviour of the model to remain relatively stable as the coupling varies, where any variation is introduced by the width. To be more explicit about this: the shape of, say, the MET distribution leads fairly directly to an acceptance, which is then converted into a limit on the visible cross section, and then converted to a limit on the coupling, which may be quite different from the coupling value that was used to estimate the MET distribution. If the MET distribution is stable, we could expect similar acceptances for different coupling values, and the process and eq \ref{Xsec_sim_coupling4} are valid. On the other hand, if the MET distribution is heavily dependent on the width/coupling, the limiting value of the coupling as calculated above would produce a quite different MET distribution to that used to calculate the limit, invalidating the equation. The required process then is to create samples with varied couplings and calculate the limit in each case, and repeat until the generated value and the calculated limit converge.
